Remember to adjust it based on your current knowledge, available time, and the specific topics emphasized by your instructor. General Principles: Break it Down: Don't try to cram everything in at once. Divide topics into manageable chunks. Active Learning: Don't just read. Summarize, create flashcards, work through examples, and teach concepts to someone else (even a rubber duck!). Practice, Practice, Practice: Solve problems, work on coding exercises, and attempt past papers if available. Review Regularly: Revisit topics you've already covered to reinforce your understanding. Breaks are Crucial: Avoid burnout. Schedule regular breaks and get enough sleep. Assumptions: Current Date: Let's"

For example, `ls /home/user/documents` would list files in the `documents` directory within the `user`'"

In your case, the function is $x^2$, so $n=2$. Applying the power rule: Multiply by the exponent: $2$ Reduce the exponent by 1: $2 - 1 = 1$ So, the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x^1$, which is simply $2x$."
